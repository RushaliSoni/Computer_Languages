Concurrent programming is a computer programming technique that provides for the execution of operations
concurrently either within a single computer, or across a number of systems. In the latter case, the term distributed 
computing is used.<br/>

<b>ABCL</b><br/>
It is actually a family of Actor-Based Concurrent Languages, which was developed in Japan during the 1980s and the 1990s. 
ABCL/1, ABCL/R, and ABCL/R2 are some members of the ABCL family.<br/>

<b>Afnix</b><br/>
It is a multi-threaded functional programming language. Its interpreter is written in C++. Its runtime engine supports 
both 32 and 64 bit platforms.<br/>

<b>Cilk</b><br/>
Created at the MIT Laboratory in 1994, Cilk supports multithreaded parallel programming.<br/>

<b>Concurrent Pascal</b><br/>
Per Brinch Hansen, a Danish-American computer scientist created Concurrent Pascal for writing operating systems and 
programming real-time systems.<br/>

<b>E</b><br/>
It is an object-oriented programming language that supports distributed programming. Mark Miller, 
Dan Bornstein and associates at the Electric Communities developed E in 1997. Its syntax resembles that of Java.<br/>

<b>Joule</b><br/>
Joule is a concurrent dataflow programming language that preceded the E programming language. It is used for distributed 
applications.<br/>

<b>Limbo</b><br/>
Developed at the Bell Labs, Limbo is used for programming distributed systems. Its striking feature is its compilerâ€™s 
ability to generate architecture-independent object code. Limbo is used for applications running on Inferno operating 
system. Alex that was initially a part of the Plan 9 operating system is the predecessor of Limbo.<br/>

<b>Pict</b><br/>
It is a statically typed programming language, which is in the experimental stage today.<br/>

<b>SALSA</b><br/>
Short for Simple Actor Language System and Architecture, SALSA supports concurrent programming, message passing, and 
distributed computing. It uses Java code for portability.<br/>

<b>SR</b><br/>
Acronym of Synchronizing Resources, SR is a concurrent programming language.<br/>
